    \section{Abstract}
    A number of derivatives of benzisoselenazolinones, including the drug ebselen, have been synthesised, and their interactions with various nitrogen bases characterised through x-ray crystallography.
    Structural studies revealed a strong interaction in all cases, with \ce{Se \cdots N} distances well within the Van der Waals radii of the constituent atoms.
    We suggest that there is a significant charge transfer component to this interaction, in contrast to some other interactions of similar strength and directionality.
    We have also found that this interaction can be enhanced via H-bonding to the carbonyl group of the benzisoselenazolinone moiety.

    \section{Introduction}
    Chalcogen bonding (Ch-bonding) is a class of non-covalent interaction which has recently piqued the interests of the chemical community, and potential applications in materials and medicinal chemistry are emerging.\autocite{Mitchell2017,Wonner2017a,Fanfrlik2014,Vogel2019}
    It bears similarities to the related concept of halogen bonding, and the ubiquitous phenomenon of hydrogen bonding, in that the result is a relatively strong and highly directional non-bonded interaction.\autocite{Paolo1974}
    This strength and directionality has been exploited in crystal engineering\autocite{Gleiter2003,Kremer2016,Huynh2017}, anion recognition\autocite{Lim2017,Lim2018,Garrett2016}, and bond activation \autocite{Wonner2017,Benz2017,Benz2017a}, and appears to play a critical role in protein folding.\autocite{Iwaoka2001,Iwaoka2015}
    Studies on \ce{Te \cdots N} Ch-bonds in solution phase have shown they can be as strong as 2.7~kcal$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$\autocite{Garrett2015a}.
    A number of interesting and potentially useful supramolecular polymers have been synthesised and characterised by Vargas-Baca \textit{et al.}, based on tellurium- and selenium-containing heterocycles.\autocite{Ho2016,Ho2017}
    
    In our efforts to apply the concept of Ch-bonding to biological systems, we turned to the benzisoselenazolinone scaffold of the antioxidant compound ebselen \cmpd{ebs}.
    \cmpd{ebs} has been known since the 1980s to effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species \emph{in vivo}.\autocite{Muller1984}
    It has remarkably low toxicity for an organoselenium compound, and is being investigated as a possible treatment for a number of conditions.\autocite{Schewe1995,Kil2007,Singh2013,Parnham2000}
    It is also an ideal scaffold for Ch-bonding, bearing a selenium atom bonded to an electronegative amide nitrogen.
    Indeed, Ch-bonding in \cmpd{ebs} has been investigated previously in the context of crystal packing of the pure compound, but there is a lack of experimental evidence for interactions with other acceptors.\autocite{Thomas2015}
    
    Numerous studies have examined the nature of the Ch-bond, in particular the balance between electrostatic effects (due to anisotropic electrostatic potential around the chalcogen atom), covalent (orbital overlap and electron delocalisation), and dispersion forces.\autocite{Oliveira2017,Pascoe2017,DeVleeschouwer2017,Kolar2016,Gleiter2018}
    In the case of halogen bonding, these contributions are generally well characterised.
    Halogen bonds range from primarily electrostatic (as in the case of fluorinated iodobenzenes\autocite{Prasang2009}) to charge-transfer dominated (molecular halogens\autocite{Mulliken1950}).
    In the case of Ch-bonding in derivatives of \cmpd{ebs}, the contributions are less clear.
    We therefore sought to characterise Ch-bonding interactions between a number of derivatives of \cmpd{ebs}, and a variety of Ch-bond acceptors.
    
    
    \section{Results and discussion}
    \subsection[Synthesis of \refcmpd{ebs,ebs.bn,tetracycle}]{Synthesis of benzisoselenazolinone derivatives \refcmpd{ebs,ebs.bn,tetracycle}}
    Compounds \cmpd{ebs} and \cmpd{ebs.bn} were synthesised via published procedures from amides \cmpd{amide} and \cmpd{amide.bn}.\autocite{Bhabak2010}
    The Se-tetracycle \cmpd{tetracycle} was isolated in poor yield as the major product from the cyclisation of primary amide \cmpd{amide.h} in an attempt to form \cmpd{ebs.h}.
    It is noteworthy that the spectral characteristics of \cmpd{tetracycle} are essentially identical to reported spectral data of \cmpd{ebs.h}\autocite{Bhabak2010}.

    \subsection{Co-crystal structures of benzisoselenazolinones and Lewis bases}
    High quality low temperature crystal structures were obtained for the parent benzisoselenazolinone derivatives \cmpd{ebs} \autocite{Thomas2015}, \cmpd{ebs.bn} and the Se-tetracycle \cmpd{tetracycle} and the chalcogen-bonded co-crystals of these compounds with a variety of nitrogen bases, including pyridine, dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), quinuclidine and 1,4-diaza\-bicyclo[2.2.2]\-oct\-ane (DABCO).
    Powder diffraction patterns were obtained of the bulk co-crystal material and compared with the single crystal data, with excellent agreement.
    This provides strong evidence of phase purity, with the exception of \cmpd{ebs.bn}$ \cdot $DMAP, which indicated the presence of the unbound monomers in addition to the Ch-bonded adduct.
    Relevant structural parameters are presented in \cref{tab:bondlengths}, while all thermal ellipsoid plots are presented in the supplementary material (\cref{sec:ch3-si}).
    In the following discussion we begin by assessing the Ch-bond donor abilities of \cmpd{ebs}, \cmpd{ebs.bn}, and \cmpd{tetracycle} by comparing the structural parameters with a common nitrogen base adduct (DMAP), followed by comparison of a single Ch-bond donor \cmpd{tetracycle} with two different nitrogen bases with markedly different basicities (pyridine and DMAP).
    
    \subsection{Effects of the benzisoselenazolinone on Ch-bond strength}
    The DMAP adducts of \cmpd{ebs}, \cmpd{ebs.bn} and \cmpd{tetracycle} are characterised by near linear \ce{N \cdots Se-N(CO)} angles (\cref{tab:bondlengths}) with \ce{N_{DMAP} \cdots Se} distances which are 2.4276(14) and 2.4331(16)~\AA\ for the two independent molecules of \cmpd{ebs.bn}, 2.371(1)~\AA\ for \cmpd{ebs}, and the strikingly short \ce{N \cdots Se} distance of 2.304(1)~\AA\ for \cmpd{tetracycle}.
    All are well within the van der Waals radii of N and Se of 3.85~\AA\ \autocite{Batsanov2001}.
    The antipodal \ce{Se-N_{1}} bond distance within these adducts is significantly lengthened compared to the free Ch-bond donors, 0.063~\AA\ in \cmpd{ebs}, 0.049~\AA\ in \cmpd{ebs.bn}, and 0.088~\AA\ in \cmpd{tetracycle}, with the degree of lengthening being related in an inverse sense to the \ce{N_{DMAP} \cdots Se} distance, in all cases the (non-antipodal) \ce{Se-C_{1}} bond is essentially unchanged.
    These structural parameters suggest an order of Ch-bond donor abilities \cmpd{ebs.bn} < \cmpd{ebs} < \cmpd{tetracycle}, which is supported by theoretical calculations which are discussed below, as well as being consistent with the \ce{^{77}Se}-NMR chemical shifts.
    
    \subsection{Endocyclic bond lengthening associated with stronger complexes}
    Further discussion is warranted on the \cmpd{ebs.bn}$ \cdot $DMAP adduct.
    Firstly, the two independent molecules of \cmpd{ebs.bn}$ \cdot $DMAP differ significantly with respect to the direction that the nitrogen base lone pair makes with the \ce{Se-N_{1}} bond.
    In molecule 1 this angle is close to collinear at 174.89(5)\degree\ while in molecule 2, this deviates significantly from linearity 158.14(5)\degree.
    Associated with this difference is a slightly longer \ce{N_{DMAP} \cdots Se} distance of 2.4331(14)~\AA\ in molecule 2 compared to 2.4276(14)~\AA\ in molecule 1 ($ \Delta =0.0055$~\AA{}; 3$ \sigma $) and a shorter \ce{Se-N_{1}} distance 1.9191(14)~\AA\ vs 1.9297(14)~\AA\ ($ \Delta =0.10$~\AA{}; 7.5$ \sigma $) indicating a slightly weaker interaction.
    This can be seen in \cref{fig:benzyl-dmap-xray-2}.
    
    \begin{figure}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/benzyl-dmap-xray-2.pdf}
      \caption{Structure of \refcmpd{ebs.bn}$ \cdot $DMAP, showing the two distinct geometries.}\label{fig:benzyl-dmap-xray-2}
    \end{figure}
    
    The structural effects described, particularly the lengthening of the \ce{Se-N_{1}} bond are consistent with donation of electron density from the nitrogen lone pair into the \ce{Se-N_{1}} anti-bonding orbital being a significant component of these \ce{N \cdots Se} Ch-bonds, which has been described before\autocite{Pascoe2017}.
    
    \subsection{H-bond enhanced Ch-bonding}
    The second reason for further discussion of the \cmpd{ebs.bn}$ \cdot $DMAP adduct is based on the structural parameters obtained for the hydrate structure \cmpd{ebs.bn}$ \cdot $DMAP$ \cdot $\ce{H2O} which was serendipitously obtained by evaporation of a THF solution in an open flask.
    The structure is shown in \cref{fig:benzyl-dmap-hydrate}.
    
    \begin{figure}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/benzyl-dmap-hydrate.pdf}
      \caption{Structure of \refcmpd{ebs.bn}$ \cdot $DMAP$ \cdot $\ce{H2O}.}\label{fig:benzyl-dmap-hydrate}
    \end{figure}
    
    \cmpd{ebs.bn}$ \cdot $DMAP$ \cdot $\ce{H2O} crystallises as a centrosymmetric hydrogen-bonded dimer in which two water molecules bridge two molecules of \cmpd{ebs.bn} across a crystallographic inversion centre.
    Of note, when comparison is made between the structural parameters for \cmpd{ebs.bn}$ \cdot $DMAP molecule 1, which has a similar geometry about the \ce{N \cdots Se} moiety as for \cmpd{ebs.bn}$ \cdot $DMAP$ \cdot $\ce{H2O}, there is a significant contraction of the \ce{N_{DMAP} \cdots Se} distance from 2.4276(14)~\AA\ to 2.4046(14)~\AA\ ($ \Delta =0.023$~\AA{}; 16$ \sigma $), and an increase in the \ce{Se-N_{1}} bond distance from 1.9297(13) to 1.9367(14)~\AA\ ($ \Delta =0.007$~\AA{}; 5$ \sigma $).
    We have coined the term `hydrogen-bond enhanced Ch-bonding' to describe this interesting structural effect.
    
    \subsection{Effects of the Lewis base on Ch-bond strength}
    We were fortunate to obtain crystal structures of the Se-tetracycle \cmpd{tetracycle} with both pyridine and DMAP, which gave us the opportunity to compare the structural effects arising from two Ch-bond acceptors with significantly different basicities.
    The pyridine adduct of \cmpd{tetracycle} is characterised by a \ce{N_{PYR} \cdots Se} distance 2.461(3)~\AA\ and \ce{Se-N_{1}} distance of 1.926(2)~\AA\ and a near linear \ce{N_{PYR} \cdots Se-N_{1}} angle, the \ce{Se-N_{1}} bond distance is significantly longer than the corresponding distance 1.883(2)~\AA\ in non-bound structure of \cmpd{tetracycle}.
    The DMAP adduct of \cmpd{tetracycle} is characterised by a significantly shorter \ce{N_{DMAP} \cdots Se} distance of 2.304(1)~\AA\ ($ \Delta = 0.157$~\AA) and longer \ce{Se-N_{1}} distance of 1.9716(9)~\AA\ ($ \Delta = 0.046$~\AA), consistent with a significantly stronger interaction.

    Ch-bonded co-crystals of the benzisoselenazolinone derivative \cmpd{ebs.bn} with the tertiary amines; quinuclidine and DABCO were obtained and structurally characterised.
    The adducts are presented in \cref{fig:benzyl-adducts}.
    The \ce{N_{QUIN} \cdots Se} and \ce{N_{DABCO} \cdots Se} distances of 2.5874(17)~\AA\ and 2.6166(15)~\AA\ for \cmpd{ebs.bn}$ \cdot $quinuclidine and \cmpd{ebs.bn}$ \cdot $DABCO respectively are significantly longer than those observed for \cmpd{ebs.bn}$ \cdot $DMAP suggesting an order of Ch-bond strengths with \cmpd{ebs.bn} DABCO < quinuclidine < DMAP which correlates well with the hydrogen bond acceptor ability of these bases, as quantified by the pK\textsubscript{HB} (\cref{tab:pkhb}).

    \subsection{DFT interaction energies and NBO analysis}\label{sec:dft-crystengcomm}
    Interaction energies for the complexes were calculated using the $ \omega $B97X-D dispersion corrected functional, which has been used to study similar systems with good agreement with coupled cluster methods.\autocite{Oliveira2017}
    All geometries were therefore optimised at $ \omega $B97X-D/def2-TZVP, and minima verified by frequency analysis.
    
    \begin{figure}
      \centering

      \caption[Interaction energies for various complexes.]{Interaction enthalpies calculated at $ \omega $B97X-D/def2-TZVP.\@ Optimised geometries for the DMAP complexes are shown to the left.}
    \end{figure}
    
    NBO analysis was conducted on the optimised geometries, which supports our suggestion that there is a strong orbital component to Ch-bonding in these systems.
    Second order perturbation theory revealed that the energy associated with n(N\textsubscript{base})$ \rightarrow $ $ \sigma^{\star} $(N\textsubscript{1}--Se) delocalisation was 12.79, 15.45, and 16.23~kcal$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$ for \cmpd{ebs.bn}$ \cdot $DMAP, \cmpd{ebs}$ \cdot $DMAP, and \cmpd{tetracycle}$ \cdot $DMAP respectively.
    %In the case of the \cmpd{ebs.bn}$ \cdot $DMAP$ \cdot $\ce{H2O} complex, the delocalisation energy was 13.51~kcal$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$.
    %This consistent with our experimental observation of hydrogen-bond enhanced Ch-bonding.

    \section{Conclusion}
    In summary, we have demonstrated the importance of Ch-bonding between derivatives of ebselen \cmpd{ebs} and a variety of nitrogen bases.
    These selenium-containing heterocycles form close contacts with electron pair donors, well within the Van der Waals radii, with predictable geometries consistent with the Ch-bonding model.
    These interactions appear to be primarily due to orbital overlap as opposed to electrostatic or dispersion mediated effects, as evidenced by lengthening of the antipodal \ce{Se-N} bond, and computational analysis, which is consistent with findings in related systems by Cockroft \textit{et al}.\autocite{Pascoe2017}
    We have also found that the strength of a Ch-bond can be enhanced via a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl group of the heterocycle.
    We hope to exploit the strength and directionality of Ch-bonds in ebselen to target biomolecules such as nucleic acids and proteins using compounds containing the isoselenazolinone moiety.

    Copper iodide (96.4~mg, 0.503~mmol) and 1,10-phenanthroline (85.7~mg, 0.476~mmol) were stirred in anhydrous DMF (4~mL) for 10~mins at r.t., then 2-iodobenzamide (510.6~mg, 2.067~mmol), selenium (209.5~mg, 2.653~mmol) and potassium carbonate (506.3~mg, 3.663~mmol) were added sequentially under a flow of argon.
    The mixture was heated at 110~\degree{}C for 12~h, when TLC showed consumption of starting material.
    The mixture was then tipped into brine (30~mL) and stirred to form a solid mass, which was extracted into DCM (20~mL) and washed with water ($ 2 \times 20 $~mL).
    The DCM solution was filtered through a silica plug, then evaporated, and the residue applied to a SNAP 50~g silica cartridge, eluting with a petroleum ether/ethyl acetate gradient.
