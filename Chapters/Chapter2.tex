\section{Abstract}
A number of derivatives of benzisoselenazolinones, including the drug ebselen, have been synthesized, and their interactions with various nitrogen bases characterized through x-ray crystallography.
Structural studies revealed a strong interaction in all cases, with Se$\cdots$N distances well within the Van der Waals radii of the constituent atoms.
We suggest that there is a significant charge transfer component to this interaction, in contrast to some other interactions of similar strength and directionality.
We have also found that this interaction can be enhanced \emph{via} H-bonding to the carbonyl group of the benzisoselenazolinone moiety.

\section{Introduction}
Chalcogen bonding (Ch-bonding) is a class of non-covalent interaction which has recently piqued the interests of the chemical community, and potential applications in materials and medicinal chemistry are emerging.\autocite{Mitchell2017,Wonner2017a,Fanfrlik2014,Vogel2019}
It bears similarities to the related concept of halogen bonding, and the ubiquitous phenomenon of hydrogen bonding, in that the result is a relatively strong and highly directional non-bonded interaction.\autocite{Paolo1974}
This strength and directionality has been exploited in crystal engineering\autocite{Gleiter2003,Kremer2016,Huynh2017}, anion recognition\autocite{Lim2017,Lim2018,Garrett2016}, and bond activation \autocite{Wonner2017,Benz2017,Benz2017a}, and appears to play a critical role in protein folding\autocite{Iwaoka2001,Iwaoka2015}.
Studies on Te$\cdots$N Ch-bonds in solution phase have shown they can be as strong as 2.7~kcal/mol\autocite{Garrett2015a}.
A number of interesting and potentially useful supramolecular polymers have been synthesised and characterised by Vargas-Baca \emph{et al}, based on tellurium- and selenium-containing heterocycles\autocite{Ho2016,Ho2017}.

In our efforts to apply the concept of Ch-bonding to biological systems, we turned to the benzisoselenazolinone scaffold of the antioxidant compound ebselen \cmpd{ebs.ph}.
\cmpd{ebs.ph} has been known since the 1980s to effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species \emph{in vivo}.\autocite{Muller1984}
It has remarkably low toxicity for an organoselenium compound, and is being investigated as a possible treatment for a number of conditions.\autocite{Schewe1995,Kil2007,Singh2013,Parnham2000}
It is also an ideal scaffold for Ch-bonding, bearing a selenium atom bonded to an electronegative amide nitrogen.
Indeed, Ch-bonding in \cmpd{ebs.ph} has been investigated previously in the context of crystal packing of the pure compound, but there is a lack of experimental evidence for interactions with other acceptors.\autocite{Thomas2015}

Numerous studies have examined the nature of the Ch-bond, in particular the balance between electrostatic effects (due to anisotropic electrostatic potential around the chalcogen atom), covalent (orbital overlap and electron delocalisation), and dispersion forces.\autocite{Oliveira2017,Pascoe2017,DeVleeschouwer2017,Kolar2016,Gleiter2018}
In the case of halogen bonding, these contributions are generally well characterized.
Halogen bonds range from primarily electrostatic (as in the case of fluorinated iodobenzenes\autocite{Prasang2009}) to charge-transfer dominated (molecular halogens\autocite{Mulliken1950}).
In the case of Ch-bonding in derivatives of \cmpd{ebs.ph}, the contributions are less clear.
We therefore sought to characterize Ch-bonding interactions between a number of derivatives of \cmpd{ebs.ph}, and a variety of Ch-bond acceptors.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{Synthesis of benzisoselenazolone derivatives \refcmpd{ebs.ph,ebs.bn}}
Compounds \cmpd{ebs.ph} and \cmpd{ebs.bn} were synthesized via published procedures from amides \cmpd{amide.ph} and \cmpd{amide.bn}.\autocite{Bhabak2010}
The Se-tetracycle \cmpd{tetracycle} was isolated in poor yield as the major product from the cyclization of primary amide \cmpd{amide.h} in an attempt to form \cmpd{ebs.h}.
It is noteworthy that the spectral characteristics of \cmpd{tetracycle} are essentially identical to reported spectral data of \cmpd{ebs.h}\autocite{Bhabak2010}.

\section{Co-crystal structures of benzisoselenazolinones and Lewis bases}
High quality low temperature crystal structures were obtained for the parent benzisoselenazolinone derivatives \cmpd{ebs.ph} \autocite{Thomas2015}, \cmpd{ebs.bn} and the Se-tetracycle \cmpd{tetracycle} and the chalcogen-bonded co-crystals of these compounds with a variety of nitrogen bases, including pyridine, dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) quinuclidine and DABCO.
Powder diffaction patterns were obtained of the bulk co-crystal material and compared with the single crystal data, with excellent agreement.
This provides strong evidence of phase purity, with the exception of \cmpd{ebs.bn}$\cdot$DMAP, which indicated the presence of the unbound monomers in addition to the Ch-bonded adduct.
Relevant structural parameters are presented in \cref{tab:bondlengths}, while all thermal ellipsoid plots are presented in the supplementary material (SUPP-Figures 7--15$^\dag$).
In the following discussion we begin by assessing the Ch-bond donor abilities of \cmpd{ebs.ph}, \cmpd{ebs.bn}, and \cmpd{tetracycle} by comparing the structural parameters with a common nitrogen base adduct (DMAP), followed by comparison of a single Ch-bond donor \cmpd{tetracycle} with two different nitrogen bases with markedly different basicities (pyridine and DMAP).

\subsection{Effects of the benzisoselenazolone on Ch-bond strength}
The DMAP adducts of \cmpd{ebs.ph}, \cmpd{ebs.bn} and \cmpd{tetracycle} are characterized by near linear N$\cdots$Se--N(CO) angles (\cref{tab:bondlengths}) with N\textsubscript{DMAP}$\cdots$Se distances which are 2.4276(14) and 2.4331(16)~\AA \ for the two independent molecules of \cmpd{ebs.bn}, 2.371(1)~\AA\ for \cmpd{ebs.ph}, and the strikingly short N$\cdots$Se distance of 2.304(1)~\AA\ for \cmpd{tetracycle}.
All are well within the van der Waals radii of N and Se of 3.85~\AA\ \autocite{Batsanov2001}.
The antipodal Se--N\textsubscript{1} bond distance within these adducts is significantly lengthened compared to the free Ch-bond donors, 0.063~\AA\ in \cmpd{ebs.ph}, 0.049~\AA\ in \cmpd{ebs.bn}, and 0.088~\AA\ in \cmpd{tetracycle}, with the degree of lengthening being related in an inverse sense to the N\textsubscript{DMAP}$\cdots$Se distance, in all cases the (non-antipodal) Se--C\textsubscript{1} bond is essentially unchanged.
These structural parameters suggest an order of Ch-bond donor abilities \cmpd{ebs.bn} < \cmpd{ebs.ph} < \cmpd{tetracycle}, which is supported by theoretical calculations which are discussed below, as well as being consistent with the \textsuperscript{77}Se NMR chemical shifts.

\subsection{Endocyclic bond lengthening associated with stronger complexes}
Further discussion is warranted on the \cmpd{ebs.bn}$\cdot$DMAP adduct.
Firstly, the two independent molecules of \cmpd{ebs.bn}$\cdot$DMAP differ significantly with respect to the direction that the nitrogen base lone pair makes with the Se--N\textsubscript{1} bond.
In molecule 1 this angle is close to colinear at 174.89(5)$^\circ$ while in molecule 2, this deviates significantly from linearity 158.14(5)$^\circ$.
Associated with this difference is a slightly longer N\textsubscript{DMAP}$\cdots$Se distance of 2.4331(14)~\AA\ in molecule 2 compared to 2.4276(14)~\AA\ in molecule 1 ($\Delta$=0.0055~\AA ; 3$\sigma$) and a shorter Se--N\textsubscript{1} distance 1.9191(14)~\AA\ vs 1.9297(14)~\AA\ ($\Delta$=-0.10~\AA ; 7.5$\sigma$) indicating a slightly weaker interaction.
This can be seen in \cref{fig:benzyl-dmap-xray-2}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/benzyl-dmap-xray-2.pdf}
  \caption{Structure of \refcmpd{ebs.bn}$\cdot$DMAP, showing the two distinct geometries.}
  \label{fig:benzyl-dmap-xray-2}
\end{figure}

The structural effects described, particularly the lengthening of the Se--N\textsubscript{1} bond are consistent with donation of electron density from the nitrogen lone pair into the Se--N\textsubscript{1} antibonding orbital being a significant component of these N$\cdots$Se Ch-bonds, which has been described before\autocite{Pascoe2017}.

\subsection{H-bond enhanced Ch-bonding}
The second reason for further discussion of the \cmpd{ebs.bn}$\cdot$DMAP adduct is based on the structural parameters obtained for the hydrate structure \cmpd{ebs.bn}$\cdot$DMAP$\cdot$\ce{H2O} which was serendipitously obtained by evaporation of a THF solution in an open flask.
The structure is shown in \cref{fig:benzyl-dmap-hydrate}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/benzyl-dmap-hydrate.pdf}
  \caption{Structure of \refcmpd{ebs.bn}$\cdot$DMAP$\cdot$\ce{H2O}.}
  \label{fig:benzyl-dmap-hydrate}
\end{figure}

\cmpd{ebs.bn}$\cdot$DMAP$\cdot$\ce{H2O} crystallizes as a centrosymmetric hydrogen-bonded dimer in which two water molecules bridge two molecules of \cmpd{ebs.bn} across a crystallographic inversion centre.
Of note, when comparison is made between the structural parameters for \cmpd{ebs.bn}$\cdot$DMAP molecule 1, which has a similar geometry about the N$\cdots$Se moiety as for \cmpd{ebs.bn}$\cdot$DMAP$\cdot$\ce{H2O}, there is a significant contraction of the N\textsubscript{DMAP}$\cdots$Se distance from 2.4276(14)~\AA\ to 2.4046(14)~\AA\ ($\Delta$=-0.023~\AA ; 16$\sigma$), and an increase in the Se--N\textsubscript{1} bond distance from 1.9297(13) to 1.9367(14)~\AA\ ($\Delta$=0.007~\AA ; 5$\sigma$).
We have coined the term `hydrogen-bond enhanced Ch-bonding' to describe this interesting structural effect.

\subsection{Effects of the Lewis base on Ch-bond strength}
We were fortunate to obtain crystal structures of the Se-tetracycle \cmpd{tetracycle} with both pyridine and DMAP, which gave us the opportunity to compare the structural effects arising from two Ch-bond acceptors with significantly different basicities.
The pyridine adduct of \cmpd{tetracycle} is characterized by a N\textsubscript{PYR}$\cdots$Se distance 2.461(3)~\AA\ and Se--N\textsubscript{1} distance of 1.926(2)~\AA\ and a near linear N\textsubscript{PYR}$\cdots$Se--N\textsubscript{1} angle, the Se--N\textsubscript{1} bond distance is significantly longer than the corresponding distance 1.883(2)~\AA\ in non-bound structure of \cmpd{tetracycle}.
The DMAP adduct of \cmpd{tetracycle} is characterized by a significantly shorter N\textsubscript{DMAP}$\cdots$Se distance of 2.304(1)~\AA\ ($\Delta$=-0.157~\AA) and longer Se--N\textsubscript{1} distance of 1.9716(9)~\AA\ ($\Delta$=0.046~\AA), consistent with a significantly stronger interaction.

\end{figure}

Ch-bonded co-crystals of the benzisoselenazolinone derivative \cmpd{ebs.bn} with the tertiary amines; quinuclidine and DABCO were obtained and structurally characterized.
The adducts are presented in \cref{fig:benzyl-adducts}.
The N\textsubscript{QUIN}$\cdots$Se and N\textsubscript{DABCO}$\cdots$Se distances of 2.5874(17)~\AA\ and 2.6166(15)~\AA\ for \cmpd{ebs.bn}$\cdot$quinuclidine and \cmpd{ebs.bn}$\cdot$DABCO respectively are significantly longer than those observed for \cmpd{ebs.bn}$\cdot$DMAP suggesting an order of Ch-bond strengths with \cmpd{ebs.bn} DABCO < Quinuclidine < DMAP which correlates well with the hydrogen bond acceptor ability of these bases, as quantified by the pK\textsubscript{HB} (\cref{tab:pkhb}).

\subsection{DFT interaction energies, NBO and NEDA analysis}
Interaction energies for the complexes were calculated using the $\omega$B97X-D dispersion corrected functional, which has been used to study similar systems with good agreement with coupled cluster methods.\autocite{Oliveira2017}
All geometries were therefore optimized at $\omega$B97X-D/def2TZVP, and minima verified by frequency analysis.

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/dft-energies.pdf}
  \caption[Interaction energies for various complexes.]{Interaction enthalpies calculated at $\omega$B97X-D/def2TZVP. Optimised geometries for the DMAP complexes are shown to the left.}
\end{figure}

NBO analysis was conducted on the optimized geometries, which supports our suggestion that there is a strong orbital component to Ch-bonding in these systems.
Second order perturbation theory revealed that the energy associated with n(N\textsubscript{base})$\rightarrow$ $\sigma^{\star}$(N\textsubscript{1}--Se) delocalization was 12.79, 15.45, and 16.23~kcal/mol for \cmpd{ebs.bn}$\cdot$DMAP, \cmpd{ebs.ph}$\cdot$DMAP, and \cmpd{tetracycle}$\cdot$DMAP respectively.
%In the case of the \cmpd{ebs.bn}$\cdot$DMAP$\cdot$\ce{H2O} complex, the delocalization energy was 13.51~kcal/mol.
%This consistent with our experimental observation of hydrogen-bond enhanced Ch-bonding.

\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion}
In summary, we have demonstrated the importance of Ch-bonding between derivatives of ebselen \cmpd{ebs.ph} and a variety of nitrogen bases.
These selenium-containing heterocycles form close contacts with electron pair donors, well within the Van der Waals radii, with predictable geometries consistent with the Ch-bonding model.
These interactions appear to be primarily due to orbital overlap as opposed to electrostatic or dispersion mediated effects, as evidenced by lengthening of the antipodal Se--N bond, and computational analysis, which is consistent with findings in related systems by Cockroft \emph{et al}.\autocite{Pascoe2017}
We have also found that the strength of a Ch-bond can be enhanced \emph{via} a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl group of the heterocycle.
We hope to exploit the strength and directionality of Ch-bonds in ebselen to target biomolecules such as nucleic acids and proteins using compounds containing the isoselenazolone moiety.

\subsection{Crystallographic data}
Intensity data was collected on an Oxford Diffraction SuperNova CCD diffractometer using either Cu-K$\alpha$ or Mo-K$\alpha$ radiation at 130.0(1)~K, or on a Rigaku XtalLAB Synergy at 100.0(1)~K. Compound \cmpd{ebs.bn}$\cdot$DMAP$\cdot$\ce{H2O} underwent a destructive phase change when cooling to 130~K, therefore data were collected at 200~K. Data for \cmpd{tetracycle} was collected on the MX1 beamline at the Australian Synchrotron\autocite{Cowieson2015}. The temperature was maintained using an Oxford Cryostream cooling device. The structures were solved by direct methods and difference Fourier synthesis.\autocite{Sheldrick2015} Thermal ellipsoid plot was generated using the program ORTEP-3\autocite{Farrugia1997} integrated within the WINGX\autocite{Farrugia1999} suite of programs.

\chapter{Further investigations into Ch-bonded complexes}

\section{Introduction}
In the previous chapter, we established that Ch-bonding is not only present in ebselen derivatives, but dominates packing in crystals of the pure compound (through \ce{Se\cdots O} interactions) and in co-crystals with a variety of Lewis bases.
In this chapter, we extend our investigation to a wider range of derivatives with systematically varied electronic properties.

Linear free energy relationships are...

\section{Results and discussion}
Our previous work had shown that electron-rich pyridines (specifically DMAP) formed the strongest Ch-bonds out of all the bases trialled.
This is roughly consistent with the hydrogen bond basicity (pK\textsubscript{HB}) of the bases (\cref{tab:pkhb}).
Methyl cation affinities?\autocite{Wei2008MethylOrganocatalysts}
The planar geometry and aromatic character of DMAP may also facilitate crystallisation, as opposed to the relatively bulky and flexible aliphatic bases which may not pack as efficiently.
For these reasons, we restricted the bases used in this study to other electron-rich pyridines.
Although DMAP is already a very strong base, the basisicity can be increased by incorporating the aniline nitrogen in another ring.
This reduces the energetic penalty associated with the delocalisation of the lone pair into the pyridine ring, by forcing a more planar geometry upon the nitrogen.\autocite{Berthelot1998,Heinrich2003EnhancingFixation}
Compounds \cmpd{py.pyrrol,py.morph} were therefore synthesised by treating 4-chloropyridine hydrochloride with 2 equivalents of the appropriate base (\cref{sch:base-synthesis}).

\end{scheme}

The benzisoselenazolone derivatives \cmpd{ebs.{ph,4no2,4cn,4cf3,4br,4co2et,4me,4ome,4oet}} were prepared by the reaction of substituted anilines with a selenenyl chloride intermediate \cmpd{diselenide}, ultimately derived from anthranilic acid (\cref{sch:ebs-synthesis}).
The one-pot selenocyclisation reaction used in the previous work often did not tolerate the various functional groups on the aryl ring, affording reduction, cross-coupling, or protodehalogenation byproducts.
All derivatives except \cmpd{ebs.4no2} were isolated in acceptable yield at room temperature, using acetonitrile as a solvent, and in the presence of a weak base (triethylamine).
Due to the strongly electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro substituent, the parent aniline of \cmpd{ebs.4no2} was not sufficiently nucleophilic to react under the same conditions.
We therefore first deprotonated the aniline using \ce{NaH} (60\% suspension in mineral oil) in anhydrous THF before adding the selenyl chloride, which afforded the benzisoselenazolone in excellent yield.

We also note the solubility trends of the products as the electron demand of the substituent increases.
The electron rich derivatives \cmpd{ebs.4ome,ebs.4oet,ebs.4me} were highly soluble even in relatively poor solvents (\ce{Et2O}, \ce{EtOAc}), while the electron poor derivatives \cmpd{ebs.4no2,ebs.4cn} were insoluble in all but the strongest solvents (DMSO).
This likely reflects the varying strength of the crystal packing due to the \ce{Se\cdots O=C} Ch-bond.

Co-crystals of the benzisoselenazolones and pyridines were grown by vapour diffusion from an equimolar solution in dichloromethane/pentane.
Relevant structural parameters are given in \cref{tab:bondlengths2}.
In addition to the structural parameters, we characterised the various Ch-bonds using Bader's QTAIM framework.
Depending on the quality of the data we were able to obtain for each crystal, we used:

\begin{itemize}
    \item experimental electron density from a multipole refinement with atomic coordinates determined from high angle refinement ($d < 0.8$\AA),
    \item experimental electron density from a multipole refinement with atomic coordinates determined by refinement using aspherical scattering factors derived from the DFT electron density,
    \item density derived from the DFT calculation.
\end{itemize}

The second ``hybrid'' strategy has the advantage of being able to capture electron density effects not fully described by DFT, while not requiring a large amount of weak high-angle (or neutron) data for the reliable determination of atomic coordinates.
The low-angle data, however, does need to be free from faults, so this strategy may still not be appropriate for all data sets.

\subsection{Hammett plots of crystallographic data.}
Evident in this data is a trend of increasing Ch-bond length with increasing electron donating character of the substituent.
There are a number of methods to quantify this property of the substituent, and we will explore a couple of the most common.
The Hammett substituent parameter $\sigma$ for a given substituent is determined from the ionization equilibrium of the parent carboxylic acid.
Although originally used to explain reaction \emph{kinetics} with an associated reaction constant $\rho$, the substituent constant provides a convenient measure of electron donating character for ground state phenomena as well.\autocite{???}
Within the context of Ch-bonding, this can be rationalised by considering the approach of the Lewis base to form the Ch-bond as an incipient nucleophilic substitution at the selenium, and invoking the Hammond postulate to relate the transition state geometry to the ground state.

Closely linked to the substituent constant $\sigma$ are the values of $\sigma^{+}$ and $\sigma^{-}$, which can be used when mesomeric effects have a strong influence on the property being studied.
Hammett substituent parameters are particularly convenient as they have been determined for a wide variety of substituents.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figures/hammett-endo-free.eps}
    \caption{Hammett plot of endocyclic \ce{Se-N} bond length of uncomplexed ebselen derivatives.}
    \label{fig:hammett-endo-free}
\end{figure}

The structural effects most relevant to Ch-bonding will manifest themselves in the vicinity of the selenium atom.
Of particular interest is the endocyclic \ce{Se-N} bond length, which serves as a measure of $\sigma^\star$(\ce{Se-N}) orbital occupancy, thus the degree of hyperconjugation and strength of the Ch-bond.

As can be seen in \cref{fig:hammett-endo-free}, there is practically no correlation between the electronic properties of the aryl ring and the endocyclic \ce{Se-N} bond length in crystals of the unbound ebselen derivatives.
This is not unexpected, as in all cases the crystals consist of one dimensional chains of ebselen molecules Ch-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of the next (\cref{fig:ebs-packing}).
As the magnitude of the $\sigma$-hole (Ch-bond donor ability) is \emph{increased} by an electron withdrawing substituent, the Ch-bond acceptor ability of the carbonyl is \emph{decreased}.
These opposing effects appear to be approximately equal in magnitude, so cancel each other out and give a very flat and featureless Hammett plot.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{Figures/ebs.me-packing.pdf}
  \caption{One dimensional chains formed by Ch-bonding between the selenium and carbonyl oxygen in \refcmpd{ebs.4me}. All other ebselen derivatives display a similar packing motif.}
  \label{fig:ebs-packing}
\end{figure}

Fortunately, inspecting the same bond length in co-crystals of ebselen derivatives and a Lewis base gives us a much clearer dependence, as can be seen in \cref{fig:hammett-dmap}, \cref{fig:hammett-pyrrol}, and \cref{fig:hammett-morph}.
This is because the Ch-bond acceptor ability is now independent of the electronic properties of the Ch-bond donor, so the \ce{Se-N} bond length is determined solely by the latter.
Linear regression analysis affords the relationship $\mathrm{r}(\ce{Se-N}) = (1.957(5) + 0.054(12) \times \sigma_{\mathrm{X}})$~\AA~with a correlation coefficient of 0.6297 for co-crystals with DMAP.

An inverse correlation can be seen in the \ce{Se\cdots N} Ch-bond length in \cref{fig:hammett-dmap}.
The gradient of the line is now negative and somewhat steeper, at $-0.15(4)$~\AA.
However the correlation coefficient is decreased to 0.5056.
The reason for this is apparent in the left hand side of the plot.
While the more strongly Ch-bonded systems (with electron withdrawing substituents) are generally very well described by the regression model, the electron rich derivatives \cmpd{ebs.4ome,ebs.4oet} vary significantly in their bond lengths.\footnote{This is also visible, though less apparent, in the plot of endocyclic bond lengths (\cref{fig:hammett-dmap}).}
Indeed, omitting these data points improves the correlation coefficient to 0.8148 while the gradient and intercept are almost unchanged at $-0.156(28)$~\AA~and $2.386(15)$~\AA~respectively, suggesting that the model is appropriate, and that there is some other effect occurring in electron rich systems.

\subsubsection{Co-crystals where \texorpdfstring{$Z^\prime=2$}{Z'=2}}
DFT calculations show that the vibrational mode associated with Ch-bond stretching is found at very low energy.
The force constant is 5--10~$\mu$dyne$\cdot$\AA$^{-1}$, which means that the energetic penalty associated with a 0.18~\AA~ deformation (the difference between the shortest and longest Ch-bond length) is only 0.02--0.03~kcal$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$.
Crystal packing forces (the sum of weak interactions such as C-H/$\pi$, $\pi /\pi$ and C-H/O interactions) are commonly accepted to be in the range of 1--2~kcal$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$, so it is perhaps not surprising that the Ch-bond is deformed by the crystal environment.\autocite{Dunitz1988}

That said, there are no obvious differences between the two Ch-bond environments in any of the crystals that display this effect.
We performed a solid state IR experiment to probe the crystalline environment surrounding the carbonyl, which is dependent on the Ch-bond environment due to conjugation through the amidic nitrogen (\cref{fig:ebs-4oet-dmap-ir}).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figures/ebs-4oet-dmap-ir.eps}
    \caption{Solid state IR spectrum of \refcmpd{ebs.4oet}$\cdot$DMAP. The spectrum of the pure \refcmpd{ebs.4oet} is shown in gray.}
    \label{fig:ebs-4oet-dmap-ir}
\end{figure}

In the pure compound the carbonyl peak is found at approximately 1590~cm$^{-1}$ and is relatively sharp and well defined.
In the co-crystal, we observe the carbonyl peak at higher wavenumber (1610~cm$^{-1}$), due to the increased double bond character, as the $\pi$ system and oxygen lone pair are no longer involved in the Ch-bond.
This effect ostensibly outweighs the \emph{decreased} double bond character caused by the shortened Ch-bond formed between the pyridyl nitrogen and selenium (\cref{fig:ch-bond-deloc}).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.74]{Figures/ch-bond-deloc.eps}
    \caption{Contributing resonance form of a Ch-bonded complex with strong Lewis bases. The double bond character of the carbonyl is decreased.}
    \label{fig:ch-bond-deloc}
\end{figure}

If there are truly two Ch-bonded environments, we would expect to see splitting or at least broadening of the carbonyl signal in the IR spectrum of the co-crystal.
This is not the case, meaning that either the difference is too small to be seen in the spectrum, or the two environments are actually the same, and the measured differences are a crystallographic artefact, either a manifestation of missed symmetry, disorder, or a doubled cell.

However, we do not believe this is likely, for two reasons.
Firstly, the data was of extremely high quality, and no alerts were raised in the ADDSYM routine of PLATON.
Secondly, a refinement was conducted with a tight SADI restraint on the Ch-bonds ($\sigma=0.0001$), which forced them to adopt the same length of approximately 1.949~\AA.
This increased the R-factor by 1.2\%, and significant residual density was visible where the pyridyl nitrogen had been displaced.
Furthermore, removal of the restraint recovered the original model, ruling out the possibility of a false minimum.

Solid state NMR of the co-crystal was also used to investigate the crystalline environment.
A sample of \cmpd{ebs.4ome}$\cdot$DMAP was first characterised by single crystal x-ray diffraction, which confirmed the polymorph and structural parameters (\cref{fig:ebs-4ome-dmap-xray}).

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/ebs-4ome-dmap-xray.pdf}
  \caption{Single crystal x-ray structure of \refcmpd{ebs.4ome}$\cdot$DMAP, displaying the two systems in the asymmetric unit.}
  \label{fig:ebs-4ome-dmap-xray}
\end{figure}

The bulk material was then crushed and homogenised, and characterised by powder x-ray diffraction.
The measured powder pattern was in excellent agreement with the pattern calculated from the single crystal data (\cref{fig:ebs-4ome-dmap-pdx}), indicating good phase purity.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figures/ebs-4ome-dmap-pdx.eps}
    \caption{Calculated vs measured powder diffraction pattern for \refcmpd{ebs.4ome}$\cdot$DMAP.}
    \label{fig:ebs-4ome-dmap-pdx}
\end{figure}

Spectra were then acquired using a 400~MHz instrument and triple resonance MAS room temperature probe tuned to \ce{^1H}, \ce{^{13}C} and  \ce{^{77}Se}.
\ce{^1H}--\ce{^{13}C} or \ce{^1H}--\ce{^{77}Se} cross polarisation was used for signal enhancement, and a spin frequency of 10~kHz was used in most cases.

\ce{CDCl3} solution spectra of the complex were also obtained on a 500~MHz instrument.
The \ce{^1H} and \ce{^1H}--\ce{^{13}C} HSQC spectra (\cref{fig:ebs-4ome-dmap-sol}) were used to unambiguously assign the \ce{^{13}C} spectrum.

    \caption{}

\end{figure}

The aromatic region of the solid state \ce{^{13}C} spectrum is shown in \cref{fig:cpmas-sol-13c}, overlaid with the corresponding solution spectrum\footnote{The \ce{^{13}C} spectrum was referenced to adamantane.}.
Good agreement is observed for all signals, with some interesting phenomena visible in the solid state spectrum.
Firstly, the signal at 138.62~ppm corresponding to C8 is split into a 1:1:1 triplet, possibly due to coupling to the spin 1 \ce{^{14}N} nucleus adjacent.
However this is not observed for the C7 signal, nor any signals in the pyridyl ring.
Secondly, shoulders can be seen on the C15/C19 and C16/C18 signals.
This indicates that the crystalline environment surrouding each DMAP is different, which provides further evidence that there are indeed two systems in the asymmetric unit.
The relatively poor resolution of the solid state \ce{^{13}C} NMR spectrum limits further analysis, particularly of the C1 signal which is obscured by several other signals.

\begin{figure}
    \centering

    \label{fig:cpmas-sol-13c}
\end{figure}

To conclusively demonstrate that there are two systems in the asymmetric unit we conducted a solid state \ce{^{77}Se} NMR experiment, which is shown in \cref{fig:cpmas-sol-77se}.\footnote{The \ce{^{77}Se} spectrum was referenced to diphenyl diselenide.}
In solution, the \ce{^{77}Se} resonance is found around 900~ppm relative to dimethylselenide ($\delta=$0~ppm), and appears as one singlet due to the averaging of all environments.
In the solid phase, the spectrum is significantly more complex, primarily due to chemical shift anisotropy which manifests as spinning sidebands.
The true anisotropic chemical shifts can only be discerned by varying the MAS spinning speed, which changes the spacing of the sidebands while leaving the parent signals in the same place.
Spinning at 12~kHz instead of 10~kHz showed that the signals at 834.69 and 867.02~ppm are the true isotropic chemical shifts, and the fact that there are two signals show that there are indeed two Ch-bonded systems in the asymmetric unit.

\subsubsection{SOME MORE ABOUT HAMMETT STUFF}

\subsection{Measurement of chemical shift anisotropy}
The chemical shift of a nucleus is not a simple scalar quantity, as solution phase NMR experiments might suggest.
The shielding, and hence the effective magnetic field felt by the nucleus depends on the electronic environment around the nucleus, which is decidedly \emph{an}isotropic, therefore incapable of being expressed as a scalar.
Depending on the orientation of the electron cloud (and other shielding/deshielding influences) around the nucleus with respect to the magnetic field, different chemical shifts will be observed for the same nucleus.
This phenomenon is the chemical shift anisotropy of a nucleus, and it is described mathematically by a second rank tensor, which is geometrically depicted as an ellipsoid.

In a solution phase NMR experiment, rapid and random tumbling of the molecules averages out the anisotropy of each signal, affording a sharp peak at the isotropic chemical shift.
This can be simulated to some degree by magic angle spinning in solids experiments, but it is often the case that the chemical shift anisotropy is more interesting that the isotropic shift, so a solid phase NMR experiment is the only way to examine it.

The shape of the chemical shift tensor can provide insight into the electronic environment of a nucleus, with large shielding components often being aligned with electronic features such as bonds or lone pairs.
It is often convenient to define a principal axis system (PAS) for the tensor, consisting of two components which describe the longest and shortest axes of the ellipsoid, and the axis perpendicular to both.
The PAS of the chemical shielding tensor is denoted by the lowercase $x$, $y$ and $z$, and the components of the tensor which are aligned with these axes are labelled $\sigma_{xx}$, $\sigma_{yy}$ and $\sigma_{zz}$.
The laboratory reference frame is denoted by the uppercase $X$, $Y$ and $Z$, with the magnetic field $B_0$ being aligned with the $Z$ axis.
A common method for transforming one coordinate system to another is through the use of Euler angles $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$, which define sequential right-handed rotations about the axes of the rotating frame.
As the chemical shielding is necessarily invariant to rotation about $Z$, we can dispense with the first of these angles $\alpha$, and simply refer to the latter two as the polar angles $\beta = \theta$ and $\gamma = \phi$.
The chemical shielding tensor is thus depicted in \cref{fig:chemical-shielding-tensor}, and this will be the convention used in this work.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{Figures/Chemical_Shift_Tensor.png}
  \caption{Representation of the principal axis system (PAS, blue dotted lines) with respect to the laboratory reference frame (black solid lines). The polar angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ relate the former to the latter. The principal components of the tensor are shown in red, and the overall shape is shown by the black ellipses.}
  \label{fig:chemical-shielding-tensor}
\end{figure}

In almost all experiments, the chemical shielding tensor $\sigma$ is only indirected measured, \emph{via} the chemical shift $\delta$, which is defined with respect to a reference nucleus such that $\delta = \sigma_{\textrm{ref}} - \sigma_{\textrm{sample}}$.
As the coordinate system as described above is somewhat arbitrary, the IUPAC convention defines the three principal components of the chemical shift tensor $\delta_{11}$, $\delta_{22}$ and $\delta_{33}$ such that $\delta_{11} \geq \delta_{22} \geq \delta_{33}$.
The isotropic chemical shift is given by the average $\delta_{\textrm{iso}} = \frac{(\delta_{11} + \delta_{22} + \delta_{33})}{3}$.
There are two other conventions for describing chemical shift anisotropy, which are useful in different contexts.
The Herzfeld Berger convention represents the chemical shift in terms of the span of the signal $\Omega = \delta_{11} - \delta_{33}$ and the skew $\kappa = \frac{3(\delta_{22} - \delta_{\textrm{iso}})}{\Omega}$ where $\delta_{\textrm{iso}}$ is the same as in the IUPAC convention.
This is particularly useful for intuitively describing the powder lineshape formed by a given signal.
The other convention is the Haeberlen convention, which defines the three principal components as $|\delta_{zz} - \delta_{\textrm{iso}}| \geq |\delta_{xx} - \delta_{\textrm{iso}}| \geq |\delta_{yy} - \delta_{\textrm{iso}}|$, and the parameters $\delta = \delta_{zz} -\delta_{\textrm{iso}}$ and $\eta = \frac{\delta_{xx} - \delta_{yy}}{\delta_{zz} -\delta_{\textrm{iso}}}$.
This convention is most useful for describing the angular dependence of a chemical shift on the polar angles $\theta$ and $\phi$, which is given by the relationship\autocite{Haeberlen1976}
\begin{equation}
  \delta_{\textrm{obs}} = \delta_{\textrm{iso}} + \delta \left(\frac{3 \cos^2 \theta - 1 + \eta \sin^2 \theta \cos 2 \phi}{2} \right)
  \label{eqn:orientation-csa}
\end{equation}

In a non-spinning polycrystalline or amorphous powder, the above expression can be integrated over the range of chemical shifts to give the characterisitc powder lineshape see in \cref{fig:ssnmr-tensor}, reproduced from the work of Facelli, Grant, and Michl.\autocite{Facelli1987Carbon-13Determination}
The sample consists of randomly oriented tensors, all of which contribute to the signal.
The principal values of the tensor $\delta_{11}$, $\delta_{22}$ and $\delta_{33}$ correspond to the two extrema of the line, and the central peak.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{Figures/ssnmr-tensor.pdf}
  \caption{Characteristic solid-state NMR powder lineshape for an asymmetric tensor e.g. in an alkene. The positions of the three principal values are shown.}
  \label{fig:ssnmr-tensor}
\end{figure}

The extremely poor S/N ratio (especially for a relatively insensitive nucleus like \ce{^{77}Se}) limits the utility of this method, as the radiated signal from the nuclei is spread out over a large bandwidth.
Spinning at the magic angle can improve the S/N ratio by partially averaging out the chemical shift anisotropy and dipolar relaxation.
Instead of the powder pattern, we instead observe a sharp isotropic chemical shift and a series of spinning sidebands which are separated from the isotropic peak by multiples of the spinning frequency.
The radiated power is thus concentrated in narrower bands, leading to a much improved S/N ratio.

An example is presented in \cref{fig:31P-ssnmr} of proton decoupled solid state \ce{^{31}P} spectra of barium diethyl phosphate, reproduced from the work of Herzfeld and Berger\autocite{Herzfeld1980SidebandAngle}.
In the first spectrum, no magic angle spinning was used, and the lineshape is characteristically broadened into an asymmetric peak (the powder lineshape).
Note the poor S/N ratio due to the broad peak.
The S/N ratio can be seen to improve as the spinning speed increases, and the sidebands become more sparse, affording a stronger signal overall.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{Figures/31P-ssnmr-0khz.pdf}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{Figures/31P-ssnmr-0.94khz.pdf}

    \caption{Proton decoupled solid state \ce{^{31}P} spectra of barium diethyl phosphate spinning at the magic angle, at the speed specified. The isotropic chemical shift is shown by the vertical dotted line.}
    \label{fig:31P-ssnmr}
\end{figure}

The principal values of the tensor are clearly easily obtained from a non-spinning sample, as they can practically be read off the spectrum.
However, the extremely poor S/N ratio (especially for a relatively insensitive nucleus like \ce{^{77}Se}) limits the utility of this method.
Spinning at the magic angle is clearly necessary to improve the S/N ratio, however this obscures the true locations of the extrema of the signal, therefore the values of $\delta_{11}$ and $\delta_{33}$, as well as modifying the position of the maximum ($\delta_{22}$).

There exist programs (such as SOLA, integrated within TopSpin by Bruker BioSpin) which can fit an experimental lineshape or sideband manifold affording the principal values of the tensor, however there is clearly a trade-off between obtaining a good S/N ratio and having enough sidebands within the limits of the signal for a meaningful fit.
Another issue is encountered with preferred orientation of crystallites, as in powder diffraction, which is not modelled in the fitting routine, leading to a poorer fit.
Perhaps the most fundamental issue stems from the fact that the sample is a powder of randomly oriented particles.
This means that the absolute orientation of the tensor with respect to the molecule cannot be determined from this kind of experiment.
Nonetheless, the \emph{shape} of the tensor is still valuable information that may be able to shed light on Ch-bonding in the solid phase.

To this end, we acquired solid state spectra of three complexes spanning the range of electron demand, \cmpd{ebs.4ome}$\cdot$DMAP, \cmpd{ebs.ph}$\cdot$DMAP, and \cmpd{ebs.4no2}$\cdot$DMAP.
\footnote{\cmpd{ebs.4ome}$\cdot$DMAP differs from the other structures, in that it crystallises in the space group $P2_1/c$, whereas \cmpd{ebs.ph}$\cdot$DMAP and \cmpd{ebs.4no2}$\cdot$DMAP both crystallise in $P\bar{1}$.
The $2_1$ screw axis in the former crystal is oriented such that it generates a symmetry equivalent molecule which is rotated by an angle of about 45\degree.
This means that the observed chemical shift tensor is the average of these two symmetry related orientations, further complicating the analysis.
Fundamentally this is due to the fact that an ellipsoid does not have twofold rotational symmetry, except about its principal axes.
The triclinic complexes \cmpd{ebs.ph}$\cdot$DMAP and \cmpd{ebs.4no2}$\cdot$DMAP do not suffer from this issue, as the inversion symmetry operation preserves the shape of the tensor.
This can be seen in the latter two principal values of the chemical shift tensor in \cref{tab:77se-ssnmr-ebs-csa}, which have the same value (within experimental error), describing a cigar-shaped tensor.}
The resulting spectra are presented in \cref{fig:77se-ssnmr-ebs}, and the extracted principal values of the chemical shift tensor are presented in \cref{tab:77se-ssnmr-ebs-csa}.

\subsection{Calculation of chemical shift anisotropy}
In order to verify our results, we also \emph{calculated} the chemical shielding tensors in order to compare the principal values, and also determine the likely orientation of the tensors with respect to the rest of the molecule (\cref{fig:77se-tensor-ebs-dmap}).
These calculations were conducted at the $\omega$B97X-D/def2tzvp level, using the GIAO method of calculating shielding tensors.\autocite{Schreckenbach1995CalculationTheory,Schreckenbach1996TheApproximation}
In order to convert these chemical shielding tensors $\sigma$ into chemical shifts $\delta$, we must reference them to a standard $\sigma_{\textrm{ref}}$.
\begin{equation}
  \delta = \sigma_{\textrm{ref}} - \sigma_{\textrm{sample}}
  \label{eqn:shieldingtoshift}
\end{equation}
Convention dictates that for \ce{^{77}Se}, dimethylselenide is assigned a chemical shift of 0~ppm.
The structure of dimethylselenide was therefore optimised and shielding tensors calculated at the same level.

The tensors (in the computation reference frame) were found to be

These values are encouragingly close to those derived from the fitting of the experimental MAS line shape, with the exception of \cmpd{ebs.4ome}$\cdot$DMAP, for reasons explained above.

Plotting the resulting tensors as ellipsoids reveals aspects of the electron density and hence shielding around the selenium (\cref{fig:77se-tensor-ebs-dmap}).
A major contributor to the tensor is of course the aromatic ring current, which leads to deshielding perpendicular to the plane of the ring.
There is also a ring current in the pyridine ring, which deshields the selenium roughly in the direction of the \ce{Se-C} bond (perpendicular to the plane of the pyridine ring).
This accounts for the large $\delta_{11}$ and $\delta_{22}$ components of the chemical shift.
The remainder is presumably due to diamagnetic shielding from the electron density.
In this we are able to see deformation of the electron cloud due to the lone pairs and the Ch-bond.
The  $\delta_{33}$ component is substantially smaller than $\delta_{11}$ and $\delta_{22}$, and is aligned with the Ch-bond, reflecting a very strong shielding in this direction.
This clearly shows the contribution of the lone pair of the pyridyl nitrogen to the electron density around the selenium, and hence the strength of the Ch-bond.

\end{figure}

This can be contrasted to the chemical shift of the non-complexed selenium (\cref{fig:77se-tensor-ebs}).
In the absence of the lone pair of the pyridyl nitrogen, the $\sigma$-hole strongly deshields the selenium, therefore the large $\delta_{11}$ component is roughly aligned with it.
There is also no deshielding ring current from the pyridine, so the $\delta_{33}$ (which is aligned with the \ce{Se-C} bond) is very small.
The $\delta_{22}$ component perpendicular to the plane of the benzisoselenazolinone ring is roughly the same, as there is no significant change in either electron density or ring currents in this direction.

To demonstrate that the $\delta_{11}$ component in the \cmpd{ebs.ph}$\cdot$DMAP complex is not entirely due to the pyridine ring current, a \cmpd{ebs.ph}$\cdot$DMF complex was optimised and the chemical shift tensor calculated.
This is shown in \cref{fig:77se-tensor-ebs-dmf}.
The largest component of the tensor is still approximately aligned with the \ce{Se-C} bond, even in the absence of the aromatic base.

These results must be taken with a grain of salt, as the chemical shifts are calculated in the gas phase (i.e. in the absence of crystal packing).
This is particularly important for the chemical shift of the non-complexed heterocycle, as such a ``free'' $\sigma$-hole would not be observed in any condensed phase (it is always filled by solvent in solution, or the carbonyl of an adjacent molecule in the solid).
Nonetheless we may draw comparisons with this caveat in mind.

\subsubsection{Measurement of CSA in a single crystal}
The calculated chemical shift tensors were useful in the absence of experimental data, and the fact that the principal values of the tensors matched the powder data so well was encouraging.
However, we wished to verify the orientation of the tensor by an experimental method.

We were fortunate to obtain a single crystal of \cmpd{ebs.ph}$\cdot$DMAP of sufficient size (approx $10\times3\times1$~mm, \cref{fig:ebs-ph-dmap-picture}) for a single crystal SS-NMR experiment, allowing us to measure the orientation of the tensor in that crystal for comparison with our computational results.\footnote{Unfortunately no other derivatives formed crystals of sufficient size or morphology for the SS-NMR experiment.}

  \caption{Single crystal of \cmpd{ebs.ph}$\cdot$DMAP used for SS-NMR.}
  \label{fig:ebs-ph-dmap-picture}
\end{figure}

In order to do this, the faces of the crystal had to be indexed to the internal structure, which was done by x-ray diffraction.
As the crystal was far too big to mount on the diffractometer, two faces were marked with different coloured pens to preserve the relation to the large crystal, then a small fragment was removed from the crystal.
This was mounted, and a short data collection afforded an indexable pattern.
The resulting planes are shown in \cref{fig:ebs-ph-dmap-index}.

The large crystal was then mounted in a goniometer probe, and spectra were acquired on a 600~MHz instrument using a Hahn echo pulse sequence.
This was necessary to preseve the extremely weak signal by isolating it from the excitation pulse in the time domain.
The spectra were referenced to a saturated solution of diphenyldiselenide in \ce{CDCl3} at 463~ppm, which was contained in a zirconia MAS rotor.\autocite{Duddeck1995}

The crystal orientation with respect to the magnetic field is depicted in \cref{fig:ebs-ph-dmap-magfield-index}, and the resulting spectrum is shown in \cref{fig:ebs-dmap-hahnecho-77se}.
The selenium nucleus in this orientation resonates at 437~ppm.

\end{figure}

Using the relationship in \cref{eqn:orientation-csa}, we are able to derive the polar angles which relate the principal axis system of the chemical shift tensor to the laboratory coordinate system.
In this case, as can be seen in \cref{fig:ebs-ph-dmap-magfield-index}, the laboratory reference frame (or at least the $z$-axis) is coincicent with the $c$-axis of the crystal, which greatly simplifies analysis by obviating the need for a further transformation between the crystal axes and laboratory reference.

DO THIS

We can calculate the chemical shift tensor using the diagonal components from the powder experiment and the rotation matrix from the polar angles:
\ifpdf{
\begin{equation}\resizebox{.9\hsize}{!}{$
  \delta = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta\sin\phi & \sin\theta\cos\phi \\ 0 & \cos\phi & -\sin\phi \\ -\sin\theta & \cos\theta\sin\phi & \cos\theta\cos\phi \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} 1616.74 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 596.21 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 380.64 \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta\sin\phi & \sin\theta\cos\phi \\ 0 & \cos\phi & -\sin\phi \\ -\sin\theta & \cos\theta\sin\phi & \cos\theta\cos\phi \end{bmatrix}^{-1}$}
\end{equation}
}
\fi
which affords
\begin{equation}
  \delta = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
and hence\begin{equation}
  \sigma = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

This agrees very well with the calculated tensor, and strongly supports our assertion that the chemical shift anisotropy is influenced by the $\sigma$-hole.

To briefly summarise, Ch-bonding induces enormous chemical shift anisotropy at the selenium, which is highly sensitive to the approach of the Lewis base and can be measured using both powder and single crystal SSNMR.
While the technique is perhaps not as sensitive as diffraction based methods, the great advantage lies in the fact that SSNMR does not require crystallinity, even at the nano scale.
This means that amorphous species such as polymers may be studies, as long as they contain an NMR active nucleus.

\subsection{Solution-phase studies}
While the above crystallographic analysis gives a useful qualitative understanding of the strength of the Ch-bond, we sought an experimental method that could accurately determine bond energies, so that we could easily compare our Ch-bonded complexes with those dominated by other interactions.

\subsubsection{NMR titration experiments}
NMR titrations are a useful tool for the determination of binding affinities in supramolecular and host-guest chemistry.
\ce{^{1}H} and \ce{^{19}F} NMR have both been used to study halogen bonded systems, however we decided to take advantage of the unique NMR characteristics of the \ce{^{77}Se} nucleus to probe the Ch-bond in our systems for the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item the nucleus has an extremely wide chemical shift range (-1000--2000~ppm),
    \item the chemical shift is very sensitive to the electronic environment around the selenium,
    \item the selenium is at the heart of the interaction, so any electronic changes should manifest clearly,
    \item the spectrum (for our compounds) is extremely simple, featuring only one singlet,
    \item the experiment is moderately sensitive (slightly more sensitive than \ce{^{13}C}).
\end{itemize}

We devised a titration experiment, where a solution of a Lewis base is gradually added to a solution of the Ch-bond donor, and the chemical shift of the selenium is measured at the various concentrations of base.
As the concentration of base increases, a greater proportion of the selenium species will be in a Ch-bonded environment, with an associated increase in electron density at the selenium due to the coordinated base.
This will lead to an upfield shift of the selenium resonance.

It is important to note that even in the absence of a Lewis base, the organoselenium species will still likely feature a Ch-bond to the carbonyl oxygen of another molecule.
This interaction can be seen to dominate the crystal packing of ebselen derivatives in the absence of any other coordinating species.
This is substantially weaker than a \ce{Se\dots N} interaction, but non-negligible.
We must therefore view these as \emph{competition} experiments, rather than an absolute measure of binding energy.

For single site binding (a valid approximation for these systems, as the single $\sigma$-hole is likely to out-compete all other interactions), the dissociation constant can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:equilibrium}
    \mathrm{K_d} = \frac{[\mathrm{ebs}][\mathrm{base}]}{[\mathrm{ebs\cdot base}]}
\end{equation}

If the Ch-bond formation/breaking is slow on the NMR timescale, two distinct resonances will be observed that correspond to the ``free'' (Ch-bonded to a carbonyl oxygen) and ``bound'' (Ch-bonded to the Lewis base) selenium species, and their relative concentrations can be determined by integration of the signals.
As it happens, this is not the case, and the process is fast relative to the NMR timescale.
The observed chemical shift is therefore the mole fraction ($f_\mathrm{ebs} = [\mathrm{ebs}]/[\mathrm{ebs}]_0$ and $f_\mathrm{ebs\cdot base} = [\mathrm{ebs\cdot base}]/[\mathrm{ebs}]_0$) weighted average of the chemical shifts of the two species:
\begin{equation}
    \delta_{\mathrm{observed}} = \delta_{\mathrm{ebs}} f_\mathrm{ebs} + \delta_{\mathrm{ebs\cdot base}} f_{\mathrm{ebs\cdot base}}
\end{equation}

If we consider only the \emph{change} in chemical shift from the free species, this becomes simply:
\begin{align}
    \Delta(\delta_{\mathrm{observed}}) & = \Delta(\delta_{\mathrm{ebs\cdot base}}) f_{\mathrm{ebs\cdot base}} \\
    & = \Delta(\delta_{\mathrm{ebs\cdot base}}) \left(\frac{[\mathrm{ebs\cdot base}]}{[\mathrm{ebs}]_0}\right)
\end{align}

From here we can rearrange the equilibrium expression (\cref{eqn:equilibrium}) and mass balance equation ($[\mathrm{ebs}]_0 = [\mathrm{ebs}] + [\mathrm{ebs\cdot base}]$), and substitute them in to arrive at the generic binding isotherm equation:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta(\delta) = \frac{\Delta(\delta_{\mathrm{ebs\cdot base}})  \times [\mathrm{base}]}{\mathrm{K_{d}} + [\mathrm{base}]}
\end{equation}

This assumes that there is insignificant depletion of the base concentration due to complexation.\autocite{Thordarson2011}
Such an assumption may not be entirely valid for this situation, which may explain the imperfect fitting.
However, the analysis is considerably simplified, and adequate standard deviations are obtained using this method.

The resulting K\textsubscript{d} values can be converted to free energies:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta G = -RT \ln{\mathrm{K_d}}
\end{equation}

A saturated solution of the organoselenium derivative in chloroform was used, due to the high solubility (to reduce acquisition time) and non-coordinating nature (to minimise Ch-bonding to the solvent).
This was spiked with a small amount of deuterochloroform for the lock signal.
Spectra were acquired on a 500~MHz instrument, using a 60\degree~pulse and 1~s relaxation delay, until an unambiguous \ce{^{77}Se} resonance was observed.
The resulting chemical shifts were then tabulated and plotted against the concentration of the Lewis base.
These are shown in \cref{fig:nmr-titrations}.

Although there is insufficient data to derive clear trends from a Hammett relationship, we can nevertheless visualise the data in a plot, which shows that the Ch-bond gets appreciably stronger with more electron withdrawing substituents (\cref{fig:hammett-dmap-nmr}).

\subsubsection{UV-Vis titration experiment}
Although extremely useful, the NMR titration technique had a number of drawbacks.
Firstly, relatively large amounts ($\sim$100~mg) of the Ch-bond donor were required.
For simple systems such as these, this was not an issue, however we hoped to apply the technique to less synthetically accessible molecules, which may not be available in such quantities.
Secondly, the experiment is quite time consuming, with tens of minutes required per spectrum.

UV-Vis spectroscopy presented a possible solution to both of these issues, with spectra collected in seconds even with extremely dilute solutions.
Interactions which have a charge-transfer component (such as Ch-bonding) can give rise to strong absorbances attributable to the n $\rightarrow \sigma^{\star}$ transition.\autocite{Blackstock1987}
However, we were unable to observe any evidence of such absorbances in our systems.
This may be due to the fact that these Ch-bonds are primarily electrostatic in origin, or because the aromatic systems are already strongly absorbing, thus obscuring the charge-transfer band.

\subsection{Ch-bonding in the gas phase}
To complete our trifecta of experiments, we sought evidence that supports Ch-bonding in the gas phase.
Broadly, we intended to isolate an ion corresponding to the complex by mass spectrometer, and subsequently fragment it by CID to regain the original species.
Naturally, this requires that one (or both) of the components of the complex have a charge, so that it can be detected by the mass spectrometer.
We initally injected an equimolar mixture of DMAP and ebselen \cmpd{ebs.ph} in methanol, and isolated an ion of m/z 398.08 a.m.u.
However, this could be assigned to either the desired Ch-bonded complex, protonated at the carbonyl oxygen, or to a H-bonded complex.
CID of this ion exclusively gave an ion of m/z 123.09 a.m.u., corresponding to protonated DMAP (\cref{fig:pos-esi-ms}).
We interpreted this as evidence that we had formed the H-bonded complex, as migration of the proton on the timescale of a collision is unlikely, and the proton is most likely to remain with the more basic species in the H-bond.
Furthermore, a \ce{N+ -H\cdots O} hydrogen bonds are very strong (in excess of 15~kcal/mol)\autocite{Emsley1980}, which is likely to out compete Ch-bonding, with estimated bond enthalpies of <~10~kcal/mol in the gas phase.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.74]{Figures/pos-esi-ms.eps}
    \caption[Positive mode ESI of \refcmpd{ebs.ph}$\cdot$DMAP$\cdot$\ce{H+}]{Dissociation of the complex \refcmpd{ebs.ph}$\cdot$DMAP$\cdot$\ce{H+} under CID.}
    \label{fig:pos-esi-ms}
\end{figure}

To circumvent this preferential formation of an H-bonded complex, we devised a system with no possibility of H-bonding.
The isonicotinate ion was used as the Lewis base, and the complex isolated in the negative ion mode with m/z 397.01 a.m.u.
CID of this ion exclusively gave a species of m/z 122.02 a.m.u., corresponding to isonicotinate (\cref{fig:neg-esi-ms}).
This provides strong evidence that a Ch-bonded complex is able to be formed in the gas phase.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.74]{Figures/neg-esi-ms.eps}
    \caption[Negative mode ESI of \refcmpd{ebs.ph}$\cdot$isonicotinate]{Dissociation of the complex \refcmpd{ebs.ph}$\cdot$isonicotinate under CID.}
    \label{fig:neg-esi-ms}
\end{figure}

Using the technique of CID, one could imagine an experiment where such a Ch-bonded complex is fragmented with gradually increasing energy, and the yield of the product ion measured.
This could theoretically be correlated with the gas phase bond energy.
Indeed, this is the basis of the technique of Threshold CID (TCID) developed by Armentrout.\autocite{Armentrout2003,Rodgers2000,Narancic2007}
Although the experiment is simple, the data analysis is not.
This is due to the often poorly characterised energy distribution of the reactant ions, and vibrational energy redistribution in the products.
These barriers are not insurmountable for simple systems (the technique has been successfully applied to metal complexes, and small non-covalent complexes), but in our moderately complex molecules with many vibrational modes, errors are likely to dominate any values extracted from the experiment.
However, we present here a proof of concept experiment, which shows the decrease in reactant ion intensity and increase in product ion as CID energy is increased (\cref{fig:ebs-tcid}).

\label{sec:diselenide_prep}
%TF-7-3
%KNOWN
Anthranilic acid (3.460~g, 25.33~mmol) was dissolved in 1~\textsc{M} hydrochloric acid (80~mL) and cooled to 0\degree C.
Sodium nitrite (1.751~g, 25.37~mmol) in water (40~mL) was then added drop-wise with stirring.
The mixture was kept at 0\degree C.

Selenium (2.080~g, 26.34~mmol) was suspended in 1~\textsc{M} sodium hydroxide (120~mL) and degassed by repeatedly evacuating the flask until the solvent began to boil, then backfilling with \ce{N2}.
One grain of sodium borohydride was added under \ce{N2} counter flow, followed by hydrazine hydrate (1.3~mL, 26~mmol).
The mixture was heated until a red colour appeared, then cooled to 0\degree C.

The diazonium solution was neutralised with a solution of sodium hydroxide (4.320~g, 108.0~mmol) in water (20~mL), then added slowly to the cooled diselenide solution.
Upon completion, the mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 1~h, then neutralised with concentrated hydrochloric acid.
The dense precipitate was separated by centrifuging, the supernatant decanted off, and the residue resuspended in hot methanol (300~mL).
The methanol solution was subjected to hot filtration, and the orange filtrate concentrated to a volume of $\sim$100~mL.
This was cooled to -20\degree C, and the resulting crystals filtered off and dried.
Recrystallisation from methanol gave \cmpd{diselenide} as a pale brown powder (1.8718~g, 37\%).

\subsubsection[Preparation of \refcmpd{dichloride}]{Preparation of 2-(chlorocarbonyl)phenylselenyl chloride \refcmpd{dichloride}}
Diselenide \refcmpd{diselenide} (1.4758~g, 3.6881~mmol) was dissolved in thionyl chloride (10~ml) with 2 drops DMF, and heated to reflux for 90~minutes.
The excess thionyl chloride was distilled off under reduced pressure, and the solid residue extracted into dry hexane (30~mL).
Evaporation of the solvent afforded \cmpd{dichloride} as yellow crystals (1.870~g, 100\%), which were used without further purification or characterisation.

\subsubsection[General procedure for the preparation of benzisoselenazolinone derivatives (procedure A)]{General procedure for the preparation of benzisoselenazolinone derivatives \refcmpd{ebs.4cn,ebs.4cf3,ebs.4br,ebs.4co2et,ebs.4ome,ebs.4oet} (procedure A)}
The appropriate amine (2.5~mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile (5~mL) and cooled to 0\degree C.
To this was added triethylamine (1~mL, distilled from \ce{CaH2}), followed by \cmpd{dichloride} (2.5~mmol) in a further 5~mL anhydrous acetonitrile.
The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2~h, then the solvent was removed under vacuum.
The solid residue was triturated with water (5~mL) and 1~\textsc{M} hydrochloric acid to afford a friable solid, which was purified by recrystallisation from ethyl acetate at -20\degree~C to afford the pure benzisoselenazolinone derivative.

\subsubsection[Procedure for the preparation of benzisoselenazolinone derivatives (procedure B)]{Procedure for the preparation of benzisoselenazolinone derivative \refcmpd{ebs.4no2} (procedure B).}
Sodium hydride (60\% suspension in mineral oil, 125.0~mg, 3.125~mmol) was suspended in anhydrous THF (5~mL) and cooled to 0\degree C.
4-Nitroaniline (treated with charcoal and crystallised from aqueous ethanol, 277~mg, 2.01~mmol) was then added and the resulting dark red suspension stirred for 5 minutes at 0\degree C.
DMAP (16.3~mg, 0.133~mmol) was then added, followed by a solution of the dichloride \cmpd{dichloride} (2.00~mmol) in a further 5~mL anhydrous THF.
The mixture was then warmed to room temperature, and stirred for 18~h to give a light yellow suspension, which was quenched with methanol (5~mL), then suspended in water (50~mL).
The resulting solid was filtered off, washed with 1~\textsc{M} \ce{HCl} and water, then dried to give a light yellow powder (336.0~mg, 52\%).

\subsubsection[Procedure for the preparation of benzisoselenazolinone derivatives (procedure C)]{Procedure for the preparation of benzisoselenazolinone derivative \refcmpd{ebs.ph} (procedure C).}
Copper iodide (98.4~mg, 0.517~mmol) and 1,10-phenanthroline (83.1~mg, 0.461~mmol) were stirred in anhydrous DMF (3~mL) for 15 mins at r.t., then 2-iodo-N-phenylbenz\-amide (653.2~mg, 2.021~mmol), selenium (196.9~mg, 2.495~mmol) and potassium carbonate (627.3~mg, 4.539~mmol) were added sequentially under a flow of argon.
The mixture was heated at 110\degree C for 8~h, when TLC showed consumption of starting material.
The mixture was then tipped into brine (30~mL) and stirred to form a brown precipitate, which was extracted into DCM (40~mL) and washed with water (2 $\times$ 20~mL).
The DCM solution was filtered through a silica plug, then evaporated, and the residue applied to a SNAP 25~g silica cartridge, eluting with a petroleum ether/ethyl acetate gradient.
The major peak was evaporated to afford colourless crystals of \cmpd{ebs.ph} (378.8~mg, 69\%).

\subsection{Crystallisation methods}
Crystals of sufficient quality for x-ray diffraction analysis were grown by vapour diffusion of pentane into a dichloromethane solution ($\sim$50~mg/mL) of either the pure Ch-bond donor, or a 1:1 mixture of the donor and the appropriate Lewis base, with the following exceptions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the non-solvate of \cmpd{ebs.4cn}$\cdot$DMAP was grown by slow evaporation from THF,
    \item second polymorphs of \cmpd{ebs.4oet}$\cdot$DMAP and \cmpd{ebs.4ome}$\cdot$DMAP were grown from diffusion of pentane into diethyl ether,
