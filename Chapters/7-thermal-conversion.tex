    This chapter was published in Cryst. Eng. Comm., 26 May 2020, and was originally titled \emph{Thermal conversion of a pyridine solvate to a de-solvate facilitated by rearrangement of chalcogen bonds. The solvate and non-solvate structures of N-(2-nitro-4-(3-oxobenzo[\emph{d}][1,2]selenazol-2(3\emph{H})-yl)phenyl)picolinamide}\autocite{Fellowes2020a}.\footnote{Compound numbering, section titles, and terminology have been updated to fit this thesis.}
    
    \section{Abstract}
    The pyridine solvate of benzisoselenazolinone \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine is characterised by planar sheets of the benzisoselenazolinone \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py} pierced by channels of pyridine molecules at an angle of 133\degree, the pyridine molecules are held in place by \ce{N\cdots Se} chalcogen bonding to the isoselenazolinone moiety.
    These channels, which extend through the structure to the surface of the crystal, provide a means for escape of pyridine from the lattice when the crystal is heated to ca. 100\degree{}C.
    Upon loss of the pyridine from these channels the remaining molecules undergo rearrangement to fill the space and in doing so the \ce{N\cdots Se} chalcogen bond in \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine is replaced by a \ce{C=O\cdots Se} chalcogen bond to give the non solvate \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}(ex.DMF).
    The geometry of the chalcogen bond requires that the two benzisoselenazolinone ring systems which are essentially coplanar in \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine twist by an angle of 138\degree~resulting in the formation of highly corrugated sheets in the non solvate.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    Chalcogen bonding (Ch-bonding) is an attractive non-covalent interaction between a Lewis base and a chalcogen atom bearing an electron withdrawing substituent (X) (\cref{fig:ch-bonding});\autocite{Vogel2019,Bleiholder2006,Garrett2015a} it is directional and has a strength similar to hydrogen bonding.
    Chalcogen bonding has applications in fields as diverse as medicinal chemistry,\autocite{Beno2015,Clark2007,Hudson2016,Iwaoka2002,Reid2014} anion sensing,\autocite{Lim2017,Garrett2016,Borissov2019} materials chemistry,\autocite{Biot2018} supramolecular chemistry,\autocite{Chen2018,Ho2016,Gleiter2018,Bleiholder2006,Huynh2017,Gleiter2003} and catalysis.\autocite{Wang2020}
    In medicinal chemistry the chalcogen bond is considered as an isostere to \ce{N-H\cdots A} hydrogen bonding (\cref{fig:ch-bonding}), this property is currently being exploited in the development of new pharmaceuticals.

    \end{figure}
    
    The mechanism of chalcogen bonding is believed to involve both electrostatic and orbital interaction components with dispersion being a lesser contributor.
    The electrostatic component involves attraction between the Lewis base and a positively charged $\sigma$-hole which is generated along the extension of the \ce{Ch-X} bond due to polarisation of the bonding orbital, while the orbital  interaction component involves mixing between the occupied lone pair orbital of the Lewis base and the vacant $\sigma^{\star}_{\mathrm{Ch-X}}$ bond on the chalcogen, both these interactions account for the directionality of this interaction to different extents.
    Whereas the electrostatic $\sigma$-hole interaction is believed to be the main contributor to the closely related halogen bonding interactions,\autocite{Prasang2009,Sarwar2010,Beale2013,Aakeroy2013,Goud2016,Stone2013} significant lengthening of the \ce{Ch-X} bond observed in the crystal structures of a number of chalcogen bonded systems is suggestive of a significant charge-transfer component to this interaction.\autocite{Fellowes2019,Pascoe2017}
    
    \section{Results and discussion}
    As part of our efforts towards a chalcogen-bonding based DNA minor-groove binding agent we required the benzisoselenazolinone \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}, which we proposed to cyclise to the benzimidazole-substituted  benzisoselenazolinone \cmpd{ebs-rhs-2py}, an analog to the Hoechst-type DNA-binding bis-benzimidazoles.\autocite{Loewe1974,Pjura1987,Martin2004}
    
    \subsection{Synthesis}
    The benzisoselenazolinone \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py} was prepared from the diselenide \cmpd{diselenide} by conversion to the bis-electrophilic selenium reagent \cmpd{dichloride},\autocite{Lesser1924} followed by condensation with 2-nitro-1,4-benzenediamine to give the benzisoselenazolinone \cmpd{ebs-nitroaniline}, which was then coupled to picolinic acid via a Yamaguchi intermediate (\cref{sch:ebs-synthesis2}).

    \subsection{Structural characterisation}
    Benzisoselenazolinone \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py} was found to be of low solubility in most organic solvents, but very small orange needles were obtained from slow evaporation from dimethylformamide.
    The crystal structure obtained using data collected at the Australian Synchrotron was that of a non-solvate form, referred to herein as \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}(ex.DMF) in the orthorhombic space group Pbca.
    A thermal ellipsoid plot for \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}(ex.DMF) is presented in \cref{fig:ebs-nitroamide-2py-dmf-xtal}.
    
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/ebs-nitroamide-2py-dmf-xtal.pdf}
        \caption[Thermal ellipsoid plot of \refcmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}(ex.DMF).]{Thermal ellipsoid plot of \refcmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}(ex.DMF). Ellipsoids are at the 50\% probability level.}\label{fig:ebs-nitroamide-2py-dmf-xtal}
    \end{figure}
    
    The crystal packing in \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}(ex.DMF) is characterised by a number of non-covalent interactions including $\pi$-stacking which forms columns extending down the \emph{b} axis between molecules of \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py} related by the \emph{b} glide plane (\cref{fig:ebs-nitroamide-2py-packing}).
    The planes defined by the central aromatic ring C8-C13 are inclined at an angle 10.3(2)\degree~to the adjacent $\pi$-stacked molecule, with a centroid (C8-C13) plane distance of 3.414(4)~\AA~and a centroid–centroid distance of 3.786(4)~\AA~representing a slip distance of 1.636~\AA.\@
    
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/ebs-nitroamide-2py-packing.pdf}
        \caption[Offset $\pi$-stacking of \refcmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}(ex.DMF) extending down the \emph{b}-axis.]{Offset $\pi$-stacking of \refcmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}(ex.DMF) extending down the \emph{b}-axis. The centroid-centroid distance is 3.786(4)~\AA.}\label{fig:ebs-nitroamide-2py-packing}
    \end{figure}
    
    Adjacent $\pi$-stacked columns are held together by chalcogen bonding interactions between the isoselenazolinone amide carbonyl oxygen and the selenium atom in the heterocyclic ring forming chains generated by the \emph{a}-glide plane extending down the \emph{a}-axis.
    The \ce{O\cdots Se} distance is 2.659(3)~\AA~and the \ce{O\cdots Se-N} angle is 173.6(2)\degree.
    The angle between the planes defined by the benzisoselenazolinone rings in the chalcogen bonded pairs is 138.8\degree~; a coplanar arrangement is presumably disfavoured as this would result in severe steric clashes with the C5 of the benzisoselenazolinone ring.
    Similar \ce{O\cdots Se} chalcogen bonding interactions have been observed in other benzisoselenazolinone derivatives related to the drug ebselen with comparable geometries.\autocite{Fellowes2019,Thomas2015,Bhabak2007,Piatek1995}
    The \ce{N{3}-H{3}} group which is flanked by the pyridine nitrogen and the nitro group engages in intramolecular \ce{N-H\cdots N} and \ce{N-H\cdots O} hydrogen bonds, but is not involved in any significant intermolecular interactions (\cref{fig:ebs-nitroamide-2py-o-se,fig:ebs-nitroamide-2py-pi-stacking,fig:ebs-nitroamide-2py-3d}).

    \end{figure}
    
    The combination of the $\pi$-stacking and chalcogen bonding generates a 2-dimension\-al network lying parallel to the \emph{ab} plane.
    These layers are extended into 3-dimensions by weaker Van-der Waals contacts between molecules related by the \emph{c} glide.
    
    Crystallisation of benzisoselenazolinone \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py} from pyridine gave rise to orange needles which were found to diffract well on the home-source diffractometer.
    The structure solved in the monoclinic space group Pc and was found to be a pyridine solvate, herein labelled \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine.
    The structure of \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine is presented in \cref{fig:ebs-nitroamide-2py-py-xtal} and shows that the pyridine solvate forms a \ce{N\cdots Se} chalcogen bond between the pyridine solvent molecule and the isoselenazolinone moiety.
    The \ce{N{5}\cdots Se{1}} distance is 2.466(5)~\AA, the \ce{N{5}\cdots Se{1}-N{1}} angle is 173.2(2)\degree, and the angle between the plane of the coordinated pyridine ring and the benzisoselenazolinone ring is 89.2(1)\degree.
    This geometry compares with previously reported chalcogen bonded adducts involving dimethylaminopyridine with simple benzisoselenazolinones.\autocite{Fellowes2019}
    It is interesting to note that upon formation of the chalcogen bond to pyridine, there is a significant lengthening of the \ce{Se{1}-N{1}} bond distance from 1.910(3)~\AA~in \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}(ex.DMF) to 1.945(5)~\AA~in \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine, which is consistent with the expected structural effects arising from the charge-transfer component of chalcogen-bonding.\autocite{Fellowes2019,Pascoe2017}

    \end{figure}
    
    Molecules of \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py} assemble into planar sheets lying parallel to the ($\bar{1} 0 4$) plane, the distance between these sheets as defined by the distance between the centroid of the atoms \ce{C{8}-C{13}} and the adjacent plane is 3.336~\AA~while the centroid-centroid distance is 4.973~\AA~representing a slippage of 3.688~\AA~(\cref{fig:ebs-nitroamide-2py-sheets-1}, \cref{fig:ebs-nitroamide-2py-sheets-2}).
    The parallel sheets of molecules of \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py} are pierced by channels of chalcogen bonded pyridine molecules which run parallel to the \emph{a}-axis at an angle of approximately 133\degree~to the plane.

    \subsection{Variable temperature studies}
    Thermal gravimetric analysis of the pyridine solvate \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine was conducted on a Mettler TGA/SDTA851 apparatus in 40~$\mu$L aluminium crucibles.
    A mass loss of 15.04\% occurred between 90--110\degree{}C corresponding to the loss of the pyridine solvate (calc. 15.26\%) followed by a second loss of 24.73\% between 300--360\degree{}C which is consistent with the loss of 121 a.m.u.\ very likely associated with the Pyr-C(O)NH moiety (\cref{fig:tga}).
    
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/tga.pdf}
        \caption{TGA analysis of \refcmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine.}\label{fig:tga}
    \end{figure}
    
    The observation that both the non-solvate \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}(ex.DMF) and \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine had the same melting point (experimental section below) intrigued us to establish whether desolvation of \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine which occurs between 90--120\degree{}C results in conversion to non-solvate \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}(ex.DMF).
    Thus we carried out variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction measurements on \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine from $-173$\degree{}C to 117\degree{}C.
    The resulting diffractograms are shown in \cref{fig:vt-pdx}.
    
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/vt-pdx.pdf}
        \caption[Variable temperature powder XRD patterns from \refcmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine.]{Variable temperature powder XRD patterns from \refcmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine, calculated powder pattern for \refcmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine and \refcmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}(ex.DMF) are the dotted lines in the top and bottom traces respectively.}\label{fig:vt-pdx}
    \end{figure}
    
    From 87\degree{}C to 117\degree{}C when pyridine is known to be lost from the sample from the TGA analysis, there is a smooth change from one crystalline phase to another.
    Furthermore comparison of the final diffractogram obtained after being kept at 117\degree{}C for 10 minutes very closely matches the calculated powder pattern for the non-solvate \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}(ex.DMF) suggesting the transformation from \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine into \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}(ex.DMF).
    The same experiment was applied to a single crystal of \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine glued on a glass fibre to establish whether this transformation occurs from a single crystal of \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine to a single crystal of \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}(ex.DMF).
    The crystal was heated to 90\degree{}C and heated at a rate of 0.5\degree{}C per minute to 120\degree{}C.
    While there was a steady decrease in the intensity of the reflections for \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine, individual reflections consistent with a single crystal of \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}(ex.DMF) were not observed, but rather, there was the development of the powder pattern for \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}(ex.DMF).
    Interestingly, throughout this transformation the crystal morphology did not appear to change significantly, but the final diffraction pattern was clearly that of a powder.
    It is likely that the transformation (which must begin at the surface of the crystal) results in fragmentation of daughter crystals of the non-solvate, thus eroding away at the mother crystal.
    We believe that a single crystal to single crystal transformation is very unlikely as collapsing of the channels containing the pyridine solvate would prevent complete desolvation.
    A plausible mechanism for this interconversion likely involves replacement of the \ce{N\cdots Se} chalcogen bond in \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine, with a \ce{O\cdots Se} chalcogen bond involving the isoselenazolinone carbonyl group from a molecule in an adjacent layer which is at a distance of 12.051~\AA~(\cref{fig:ebs-nitroamide-2py-transformation}).

    \section{Conclusion}
    The structure of \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine is characterised by planar sheets of the benzisoselenazolinone \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py} pierced by channels of pyridine molecules at an angle 133\degree, the pyridine molecules are held in place by \ce{N\cdots Se} chalcogen bonding to the isoselenazolinone moiety.
    These channels which extend through the structure to the surface of the crystal provide a means for escape of pyridine from the lattice when the crystal is heated to ca. 100\degree{}C.
    Upon loss of the pyridine from these channels the remaining molecules undergo rearrangement to fill the space and in doing so the \ce{N\cdots Se} chalcogen bond in \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine is replaced by a \ce{C=O\cdots Se} chalcogen bond to give the non solvate \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}(ex.DMF).
    The geometry of the chalcogen bond requires that the two benzisoselenazolinone ring systems which are essentially coplanar in \cmpd{ebs-nitroamide-2py}$\cdot$pyridine twist by an angle of 138\degree~resulting in the formation of highly corrugated sheets in the non solvate.
