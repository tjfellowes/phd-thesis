This PhD has been funded by the Australian Government through an Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship from 2017 to 2021.

Participation in the Gordon Research Conference (Physical Organic Chemistry, NH, USA, 2019) was facilitated by funding from the University of Melbourne through a Science Abroad Travel Scholarship (2019).

We gratefully acknowledge Sirtex Medical for general funding and the Australian Synchrotron for beam time via the Collaborative Access Program (proposal number 13618b).

This work was undertaken using the LIEF HPC-GPGPU facility hosted at the University of Melbourne.
This facility was established with the assistance of LIEF grant LE170100200.

We also acknowledge the Molecular Structure Elucidation Facility at the University of Melbourne, which was established with the assistance of LIEF Grant LE170100065.
